## Overview

The ContentFlow SaaS platform uses PostgreSQL as its primary database with Prisma ORM for database operations. This document describes the implemented strategies for ensuring data integrity, enabling seamless schema evolution, and providing robust disaster recovery capabilities.

## Backup Strategy

### Backup Types

1. **Full Database Backups**
   - Frequency: Daily at off-peak hours (2 AM)
   - Retention: 30 days
   - Storage: Local storage and cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or equivalent)
   - Encryption: AES-256 encryption at rest

2. **Incremental Backups**
   - Frequency: Every 6 hours
   - Retention: 7 days
   - Storage: Cloud storage
   - Purpose: Point-in-time recovery

3. **Transaction Log Backups**
   - Frequency: Every 15 minutes
   - Retention: 24 hours
   - Storage: High-performance storage
   - Purpose: Real-time recovery

### Backup Implementation

The backup system is implemented using shell scripts and Node.js services:

- [backup-database.sh](../scripts/backup-database.sh): Main backup script
- [restore-database.sh](../scripts/restore-database.sh): Database restore script
- [validate-backup.sh](../scripts/validate-backup.sh): Backup validation script
- [backup-service.ts](../lib/backup-service.ts): Node.js backup service
- [backup-validator.ts](../lib/backup-validator.ts): Backup validation service

### Backup Configuration

The backup system is configured using [backup-config.json](../config/backup-config.json):

```json
{
  "backup": {
    "strategies": {
      "full": {
        "frequency": "daily",
        "time": "02:00",
        "retentionDays": 30
      },
      "incremental": {
        "frequency": "6hours",
        "retentionDays": 7
      },
      "transactionLog": {
        "frequency": "15minutes",
        "retentionDays": 1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Migration Framework

The platform uses Prisma's migration workflow:

1. **Development**: Schema changes in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. **Generation**: `npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name`
3. **Review**: Manual review of generated SQL migration files
4. **Testing**: Run migrations in staging environment
5. **Deployment**: Apply migrations to production

### Migration Implementation

The migration system is implemented using:

- [validate-migration.sh](../scripts/validate-migration.sh): Migration validation script
- [migration-validator.ts](../lib/migration-validator.ts): Migration validation service
- [migration-service.ts](../lib/migration-service.ts): Migration service

### Migration Best Practices

1. Prefer additive changes over destructive ones
2. Use multiple small migrations instead of large ones
3. Always test migrations in staging first
4. Separate schema and data migrations
5. Use batch processing for large data operations

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Backup Monitoring

The monitoring system tracks:

- Backup success/failure notifications
- Backup size and duration tracking
- Storage space monitoring
- Restore test result tracking

### Migration Monitoring

The monitoring system tracks:

- Migration success/failure notifications
- Migration duration tracking
- Database performance impact monitoring
- Application health checks

### Implementation

- [monitoring-service.ts](../lib/monitoring-service.ts): Main monitoring service
- [monitor-backup.sh](../scripts/monitor-backup.sh): Backup monitoring script
- [monitor-migration.sh](../scripts/monitor-migration.sh): Migration monitoring script

## Rollback Procedures

### Prisma Migration Rollback

Prisma does not support direct rollback of migrations. The recommended approaches are:

1. **Restore from Backup**: Restore database from a backup taken before the migration
2. **Migration Reset**: Use `prisma migrate reset` for development environments
3. **Manual Rollback**: Create reverse migrations manually for specific use cases

### Implementation

- [rollback-migration.sh](../scripts/rollback-migration.sh): Rollback script
- [rollback-service.ts](../lib/rollback-service.ts): Rollback service

## Security Considerations

### Backup Security

1. Encrypt backups at rest and in transit
2. Restrict access to backup storage
3. Regularly rotate encryption keys
4. Implement audit logging for backup operations

### Migration Security

1. Validate migration scripts before execution
2. Restrict migration privileges
3. Audit all migration operations
4. Implement secure credential management

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

- Target: 15 minutes data loss maximum
- Achieved through frequent transaction log backups

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

- Target: 2 hours for full recovery
- Achieved through automated restore procedures

### Recovery Procedures

1. Identify the last good backup
2. Restore database from backup
3. Apply transaction logs up to desired point
4. Validate data integrity
5. Resume application operations

```

### Scheduling

Backups and monitoring are scheduled using cron jobs. See [cron-config.txt](../config/cron-config.txt) for the complete schedule.

### Environment Variables

The backup and migration scripts use the following environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `DATABASE_HOST`: Database host
- `DATABASE_PORT`: Database port (default: 5432)
- `DATABASE_NAME`: Database name
- `DATABASE_USER`: Database user
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `BACKUP_DIR`: Directory for local backups (default: /backups)

## Testing Strategy

### Backup Testing

- Weekly restore tests
- Backup integrity verification
- Performance benchmarking

### Migration Testing

- Staging environment testing
- Migration dry-run procedures
- Rollback testing

### Disaster Recovery Testing

- Quarterly full recovery drills
- Team response time measurement
- Process documentation updates
