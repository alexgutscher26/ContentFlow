# Prisma Schema Implementation for ContentFlow

## Overview

This document outlines the completion of the Prisma schema implementation for the ContentFlow SaaS platform. The task is to ensure that the Prisma schema matches all tables in the database schema as defined in the migration files.

## Current State Analysis

After analyzing the existing Prisma schema and database migration files, I found that:

1. The Prisma schema already contains all the required models:
   - User
   - Organization
   - Post
   - Subscription
   - Analytics
   - TeamMember
   - Draft
   - Comment
   - Notification
   - UserSetting

2. All models have the correct fields and relationships as defined in the SQL migration file.

3. All foreign key constraints are properly mapped in the Prisma schema.

## Verification Process

To ensure the Prisma schema matches all tables in the database schema:

1. **Model Verification**: Each model in the Prisma schema was compared with the corresponding CREATE TABLE statement in the migration SQL file.
2. **Field Verification**: Each field in every model was verified against the column definitions in the SQL schema.
3. **Relationship Verification**: All relations between models were checked against the foreign key constraints in the SQL schema.
4. **Index Verification**: Unique indexes and primary keys were confirmed to match between Prisma and SQL schemas.

## Schema Completeness

The following models have been verified as complete and matching the database schema:

### User Model
- Contains all required fields: id, email, firstName, lastName, etc.
- Properly linked to Organization, Post, TeamMember, and other related models
- Includes all necessary relations and back-relations

### Organization Model
- Contains all required fields: id, name, slug, subscriptionId, etc.
- Properly linked to User, Post, Subscription, TeamMember, and Draft models

### Post Model
- Contains all required fields: id, userId, organizationId, content, etc.
- Properly linked to User, Organization, Analytics, and Draft models

### Subscription Model
- Contains all required fields: id, organizationId, stripeSubscriptionId, tier, etc.
- Properly linked to Organization model

### Analytics Model
- Contains all required fields: id, postId, linkedinPostId, impressions, etc.
- Properly linked to Post model

### TeamMember Model
- Contains all required fields: id, userId, organizationId, role, etc.
- Properly linked to User and Organization models
- Includes self-referencing relation for invitedBy field

### Draft Model
- Contains all required fields: id, postId, content, version, etc.
- Properly linked to Post, User, Comment, and Organization models
- Includes relations for createdBy and approvedBy users

### Comment Model
- Contains all required fields: id, draftId, userId, content, etc.
- Properly linked to Draft and User models
- Includes self-referencing relation for resolvedBy field

### Notification Model
- Contains all required fields: id, userId, type, title, etc.
- Properly linked to User model

### UserSetting Model
- Contains all required fields: id, userId, emailNotifications, etc.
- Properly linked to User model

## Relationships Mapping

All foreign key relationships have been properly mapped in the Prisma schema:

1. User ↔ Organization (Many-to-One)
2. User ↔ Post (One-to-Many)
3. Organization ↔ Post (One-to-Many)
4. Organization ↔ Subscription (One-to-Many)
5. Post ↔ Analytics (One-to-Many)
6. User ↔ TeamMember (One-to-Many)
7. Organization ↔ TeamMember (One-to-Many)
8. User ↔ Draft (One-to-Many via createdBy)
9. Post ↔ Draft (One-to-One optional)
10. Draft ↔ Comment (One-to-Many)
11. User ↔ Comment (One-to-Many)
12. User ↔ Notification (One-to-Many)
13. User ↔ UserSetting (One-to-One)

## Indexes and Constraints

All necessary indexes and constraints have been implemented:

1. Primary keys for all models
2. Unique indexes for:
   - User.email
   - Organization.slug
   - Subscription.stripeSubscriptionId
   - UserSetting.userId
3. Foreign key constraints matching the SQL schema

## Conclusion

The Prisma schema implementation is complete and matches all tables in the database schema. All models, fields, relationships, and constraints have been properly defined in the Prisma schema file.
